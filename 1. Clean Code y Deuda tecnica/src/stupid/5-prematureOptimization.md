## Premature Optimization

Keeping options open by delaying decision making allows us to give greater relevance to what is most important in an application.
We must not anticipate the requirements and develop unnecessary abstractions that may add accidental complexity.

#### What is Accidental complexity?
when we implement a complex solution to the bare minimum

### What is a essential complexity
Complexity is inherent in the problem
