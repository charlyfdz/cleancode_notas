### couplers

Contribute to excessive coupling between classes or show what happens if coupling is overridden by excessive delegation

- Feature envy: when a method accesses data from another class instead of its own data If things change at the same time, they must stay in the same place

- Inappropriate intimacy: When one class uses another class's fields

- Chain of messages: when we have a function or module that calls many other methods or functions through more functions

- Midle man: If a class performs an action and that action is to delegate to another class, then it is unnecessary for that class to exist
