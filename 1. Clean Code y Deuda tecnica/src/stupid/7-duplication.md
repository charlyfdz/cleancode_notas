## Duplication

There are two types:

### The real
- Identical code and fulfills the same function
- A change would imply updating all the identical code in several places
- Increase chances of human error by forgetting a part to update
- More unnecessary tests

### The accidental
- similar code but fulfills different functions
- When there is a change, you only have to modify a single place
- this type of duplication can be worked with parameters or optimizations
