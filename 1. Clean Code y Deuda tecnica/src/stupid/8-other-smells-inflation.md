### other smells Inflations

- Inflation: when a method, class or a function begins to grow a lot.

It is necessary to find a way to cut it and make small functions, classes or methods

- Primitive obsession:

When they are added incorrectly they will build primitives instead of building modules.

If you have a large number of variables we need to make classes, methods that allow us to reuse and understand the code

- Long list of parameters

When you have more than 4 or 5 parameters in a method

Objects can be used to be able to group them
